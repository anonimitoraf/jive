#+TITLE: On Implementing Modules

* Requirements
** Updating an import should reflect in all the references to that import
- Although, variable assignments to the import wouldn't auto-update. They can however, re-eval those assignments.
  TODO State this in the docs!

* Plan of attack
** First transformation phase: CommonJS -> ES
- Although, because there is no direct transformation for stuff like =const [ a, b ] = require('something')=, it would have to be transformed to something like:
 #+begin_src javascript
 import _something from 'something';
 const [ a, b ] = _something;
 #+end_src
but without the bindings being registered directly as part of the namespace.
It would make sense the implement the latter part first:
#+begin_quote
but without the bindings being registered directly as part of the namespace.
#+end_quote
because it's more _uncertain_ (in terms of being doable) than doing the CommonJS -> ES transformation
